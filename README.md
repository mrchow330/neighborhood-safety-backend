# Neighborhood Safety Backend

This repository contains the backend API for the Neighborhood Safety App. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js and is responsible for handling user-submitted safety reports, storing them in a MongoDB database, and providing endpoints for interacting with the data. This API acts as a server to create the main connection and communication between the app and our MongoDB database remotely.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this project:

- **Required**:
  - `express`: For building the server and handling API routes.
  - `mongoose`: For connecting to and interacting with the MongoDB database.
  - `dotenv`: For managing environment variables securely.
  - `cors`: For enabling cross-origin resource sharing.

- **Optional**:
  - `nodemon`: For automatically restarting the server during development when file changes are detected.

## Features

- **Submit Reports**: User reports can be submitted to our database using this server.
- **Database Integration**: Reports are stored in a MongoDB database for persistence.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for submitting and managing reports.
- **Health Check**: A `/api/health` endpoint provides real-time server status, including database connection status and uptime tracking.
- **Frontend Integration**: Displays server status and uptime on the frontend, with real-time updates (if need be).

## Project Structure

- `server.js`: The main entry point of the application, which sets up the Express server, connects to MongoDB, and handles API routes.
- `/features`: All the features I implemented because I'm bored
   - `/health.html`: A frontend page that displays the server's health status and uptime, updating every second (displayed in index.html)
   - `/api-tester.html`: A frontend page to test report submission (kind of unecessary but whatever)
- `api/reports.js`: Contains the route for handling report submissions.
- `vercel.json`: Configuration for deploying the backend on Vercel.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <github.com/mrchow330/neighborhood-safety-backend>
   cd neighborhood-safety-backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Dependencies to install:
   - `express`
   - `mongoose`
   - `dotenv`
   - `cors`
   - `nodemon` (optional)


3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
     PORT=3000
     ```
   - **WARNING**: Ensure your `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being uploaded to the repository and running into security risks (since your MongoDB connection will contain your password).

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- **Endpoint**: `/api/health`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Description**: Returns the server's health status in real time. Also returns the server's uptime.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "Server is running",
    "database": "Connected",
    "uptime": 12345.678,
    "lastUpTime": "2025-04-04T12:34:56.789Z",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-04T12:35:56.789Z"
  }
  ```

### Submit Reports
- **Endpoint**: `/api/reports`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Submits a new safety report. Usually done on the frontend.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "report_id": "12345",
    "issueType": "Pothole",
    "location": "123 Main St",
    "description": "Large pothole causing traffic issues",
    "photoUri": "http://example.com/photo.jpg"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Report submitted successfully",
    "report": {
      "report_id": "12345",
      "issueType": "Pothole",
      "location": "123 Main St",
      "description": "Large pothole causing traffic issues",
      "photoUri": "http://example.com/photo.jpg",
      "createdAt": "2025-04-04T12:34:56.789Z",
      "status": "Submitted"
    }
  }
  ```

## Frontend Features

- **Health Status Display**: The `features/health.html` page displays the server's health status (`Server is running` or `Server is down`) and uptime in a user-friendly format.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The health status and uptime are updated every second using JavaScript.

## Deployment

This backend can be deployed on platforms like Vercel. Ensure that the `vercel.json` file is properly configured for deployment. When deploying with Vercel, there are two methods.

### Deployment on Vercel (Locally)

To deploy this backend on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Vercel Account**
   - If you haven't created an account, create an account on https://vercel.com.

2. **Install the Vercel CLI**:
   - If you donâ€™t already have the Vercel CLI installed, install it globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     ```

3. **Login to Vercel**:
   - Log in to your Vercel account:
     ```bash
     vercel login
     ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Add your environment variables to Vercel:
     ```bash
     vercel env add MONGO_URI
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to add your MongoDB connection string.

5. **Deploy the Project**:
   - Run the following command to deploy the project:
     ```bash
     vercel
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure the project. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` file and deploy the backend.

6. **Test the Deployment**:
   - Once deployed, Vercel will provide a URL for your backend (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
   - Test the `/api/health` endpoint:
     ```bash
     curl https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/health
     ```
   - Note: If this doesn't work, don't worry. You can skip this step.

7. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Access the `features/health.html` page (different from `/api/health`) by navigating to:
     ```
     https://your-project-name.vercel.app/features/health.html
     ```

### Deployment on Vercel (Git)
This method is a lot more faster than the local method. This requires an existing Git repository linked to this project: https://github.com/mrchow330/neighborhood-safety-backend or your own repository.

1. Create an account or login to https://vercel.com
2. Add a new project

3. If you're logged in using GitHub, you can import the Git Repository
4. If you're on an existing project, go to settings.
5. Under "Git", connect to an existing Git Repository
